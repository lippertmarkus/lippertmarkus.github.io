This is the personal blog of Markus Lippert. I'm a technology enthusiast living near Ulm, a city in the south of Germany. I currently work for COSMO CONSULT as a DevOps Engineer and I'm also a Master's student in computer science.

I mostly write about DevOps, Containers, Orchestration, Cloud-native, IaC and Azure. Refer to my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lippertmarkus) if you want to know more about the technologies I work with and what I'm currently doing in the open-source space. In my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lippertmarkus/) you can find information around my career, professional experience and past projects.

When I'm not busy trying out new technologies, I also love to work on my personal development by doing sports, hiking or reading.
